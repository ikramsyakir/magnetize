# Magnetize

Magnetize is a web application built with modern technologies such as Laravel, Bootstrap 4, RESTful API etc. The purpose I built this software because I want to keep this software up to date with current modern technology using the framework that I developed. Aside from that, I use this software as an API to learn other frameworks (Mobile Apps, SPA, Desktop Apps etc)
